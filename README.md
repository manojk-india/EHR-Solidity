# EHR-Solidity
This is a project where I implemented a idea of electronic healthcare system using solidity .........

This project contains mainly 4 entities admins,patients,clinics,doctors where trust is fully ensured between each entity and i developed a application where these entities can interact freely on the terms provided......
Here basically for any entity to enter the electronic healthcare system they must pay the threshold of 1 eth to the admin and after that they can access the service of the smart contract freely........
